<p style="font-size: 19px;">Aster is a genus of perennial flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Its circumscription has been narrowed, and it now encompasses around 180 species, all but one of which are restricted to Eurasia; many species formerly in Aster are now in other genera of the tribe Astereae. Aster amellus is the type species of the genus and the family Asteraceae.
<h4>PLANTING ASTERS</h4>
<p style="font-size: 19px;">While asters can be grown from seed, germination can be uneven. You can start the seeds indoors during the winter by sowing seeds in pots or flats and keeping them in the refrigerator for 4 to 6 weeks to simulate winter dormancy. They need this period of colder weather to kickstart germination.
Sow seeds one inch deep in soil, placing them in a sunny spot in your home. Plant young plants outside after the danger of frost has passed in the spring. (See local frost dates.)
The best time to plant young asters is in mid- to late spring. Fully-grown, potted asters may be planted as soon as they become available in your area (typically in the fall).
Space asters 1 to 3 feet apart, depending on the type and how large it’s expected to get.
Give plants plenty of water at the time of planting.
Add mulch after planting to keep soil cool and prevent weeds.</p>

    Lamprocapnos spectabilis (bleeding heart or Asian bleeding-heart)is a species of flowering plant in the poppy family Papaveraceae, native to Siberia, northern China, Korea and Japan. It is the sole species in the monotypic genus Lamprocapnos, but is still widely referenced under its old name Dicentra spectabilis (now listed as a synonym). It is valued in gardens and in floristry for its heart-shaped pink and white flowers, borne in spring.
    Other common names include lyre flower, heart flower and lady-in-a-bath.
   
    </p>
    <h4>PLANTING BLEEDING HEART</h4>
    <p style="font-size: 19px;">Care for bleeding heart includes keeping the soil consistently moist by regular watering. The bleeding heart plant likes to be planted in organic soil in a shady or part shade area. Work compost into the area before planting the bleeding heart plant in fall or spring. Organic mulch breaks down over time to supply nutrients and helps retain moisture. Growing bleeding hearts need a cool, shady area for optimum bloom in warmer southern zones, but farther north this specimen may bloom in a full sun location. An herbaceous perennial, the bleeding heart plant dies back to the ground as the heat of summer arrives. As the bleeding heart plant begins to yellow and wither away, foliage may be cut back to the ground as a part of care for bleeding heart. Do not remove the foliage before it turns yellow or brown; this is the time when your bleeding heart plant is storing food reserves for next year’s growing bleeding hearts.

        Hesperocallis is a genus of flowering plants that includes a single species, Hesperocallis undulata, known as the desert lily or ajo lily.
        
        It is found in the desert areas of southwestern North America, in Northwestern Mexico, California, and Arizona. The plant grows in Mojave Desert and Sonoran Desert habitats.
        The bulbs of the desert lily were eaten by native peoples.
        </p>
    
        <p style="font-size: 19px;" >“Desert Lily” is very beautiful, bulb fanciers would love to bring it into horticulture. The seeds germinate easily in winter when grown in a well-drained mix. It is important to keep the seedlings in growth and not allow them to go dormant. Once the seedlings go dormant, getting them to break dormancy is a challenge. Even a few who have gotten them to come into growth again have not had success in getting plants to bloom. The Spanish settlers called this plant Ajo, which means garlic. They got the idea when they dug up one of the bulbs (not a good thing to do) and tasted it.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 19px;">
            Echinacea is a genus, or group of herbaceous flowering plants in the daisy family. The genus Echinacea has ten species, which are commonly called coneflowers. They are found only in eastern and central North America, where they grow in moist to dry prairies and open wooded areas. They have large, showy heads of composite flowers, blooming from early to late summer. These flowering plants and their parts have different uses. Some species are cultivated in gardens for their showy flowers. Echinacea purpurea is used in folk medicine.Two of the species, E. tennesseensis and E. laevigata, are listed in the United States as endangered species
            </p><h4>PLANTING</h4>
            <p style="font-size: 19px;">Light: Echinacea thrives in full to partial sun. Plants need at least four hours of sunlight per day. The plants grow natively along the edges of woodlands, so they will thrive in spots with morning shade and afternoon sun or vice versa.

            Soil: Echinacea will tolerate poor rocky soil, but will not grow in wet, mucky soil. Mulch plants with compost at the time of planting.

            Spacing: Coneflowers are clumping plants. One plant will tend to get larger, but it will not spread and overtake the garden via roots or rhizomes. The eventual size of the plant clump depends on the cultivar, so check the mature size listed in the plant description to help you decide on spacing. If a plant is estimated to grow to 18 inches wide, leave 18 inches between plants. Because Echinacea establish deep taproots, you need to plant them where you want them. They do not like to be moved once established.

            Planting: Plant Echinacea plants in the spring or the fall, in well-drained soil in full to part sun. Echinacea is easy to grow from seed, as well, but requires a cold, moist period—called stratification—in order to germinate. Sow seeds thickly in the fall (after hard-frost in the north and before winter rains elsewhere), covering lightly to discourage birds from eating them. Seeds will germinate in the spring. Most plants will bloom during the second year—one reason it’s advantageous to start with transplants.

                <p style="font-size: 19px;">
                Freesia is a genus of herbaceous perennial flowering plants in the family Iridaceae, first described as a genus in 1866 by Christian Friedrich Ecklon (1886) and named after the German botanist and medical practitioner, Friedrich Freese (1795-1876). It is native to the eastern side of southern Africa, from Kenya south to South Africa, most species being found in Cape Provinces.Species of the former genus Anomatheca are now included in Freesia.The plants commonly known as "freesias", with fragrant funnel-shaped flowers, are cultivated hybrids of a number of Freesia species. Some other species are also grown as ornamental plants.
                </p>
                <h4>PLANTING</h4>
                <p style="font-size: 19px;">Knowing how and when to plant freesia bulbs is important for their success in the garden. Start by choosing a location with full sun or light morning shade and well-drained soil. Prepare the bed by digging and loosening the soil to a depth of at least 8 inches (20 cm.). Plant the freesia bulbs, or corms, at least 2 inches (5 cm.) deep and 2 to 4 inches (5-10 cm.) apart. Freesias look their best planted in groups or masses rather than in rows. Masses of a single color make a striking display. Freesias bloom 10 to 12 weeks after you plant the corms. You can extend the bloom season by planting the bulbs at weekly intervals.

                    Gerbera is a genus of plants in the Asteraceae (daisy family). It was named in honour of German botanist and medical doctor Traugott Gerber(1710-1743) who travelled extensively in Russia and was a friend of Carl Linnaeu.
                    
                    Gerbera is native to tropical regions of South America, Africa and Asia. The first scientific description of a Gerbera was made by J.D. Hooker in Curtis's Botanical Magazine in 1889 when he described Gerbera jamesonii, a South African species also known as Transvaal daisy or Barberton daisy. Gerbera is also commonly known as the African daisy.
                    </p>
                    <h4>PLANTING</h4>
                    <p style="font-size: 19px;">Growing gerbera daisy plants is possible from seed, seedlings or division. Seed is the cheapest method, but seeds must be sown immediately because they lose viability quickly after opening. Keep in mind seeds may also not be true to form. Growing from seedlings or divided plants is easier and you can be sure what the flower type will be. If you have older plants, the crowns can be lifted and divided in early spring. Remove lower leaves and replant immediately.

                        Hibiscus is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. The genus is quite large, comprising several hundred species that are native to warm temperate, subtropical and tropical regions throughout the world. Member species are renowned for their large, showy flowers and those species are commonly known simply as "hibiscus", or less widely known as rose mallow. Other names include hardy hibiscus, rose of sharon, and tropical hibiscus.
                        </p>
                        <h4>PLANTING</h4>
                        <p style="font-size: 19px;">Rose Mallow and Swamp Hibiscus can be purchased as young plants from nurseries or started from seed or cuttings. They should be planted in the spring.
                            Seeds can be sown indoors 12 weeks before the last spring frost. (See local frost dates.)
                            Alternatively, seeds can be sown outdoors after the last expected frost date.
                            Rose of Sharon are typically purchased as small shrubs.

                            <h4>PLANTING</h4>
                            <p style="font-size: 19px;">Soak the seeds in lukewarm water for 1 hour before sowing to trigger sprouting.
                                It’s also possible to sow directly in the ground starting in mid-May but blooming will only occur much later, which is a bit sad for an annual plant.
                                Place Ipomoea indica in a very sunny spot.
                                Place it next to a spot that is often used like a terrace, to fully take advantage of its beautiful blooming.</p>
